ABOUT THE DATA

=== FILES *fpi and *times =====================================

The fpi files show a diphthong, word where the diphthong was 
pronounced, its F1, F2, F3, intensity, and pitch values.

In ie. "oy_l_1 toyed", number 1 refers to "o" vowel of the diphthong,
2 to "y".

Files *times list word and diphthong lengths.

The segmentation procedure is explained at:
<http://www.languagebits.com/files/segmentation.pdf>

The label "cor" refers to the corpus data (female ESL first year 
university students), and "ref" to the referent RP English speaker
(female, around 30, well-educated).
